## Practice of Neural Networks and Deep Learning
A python implementation of Neural Nets inspired from **Michael Nelson's** book on [Neural Networks and Deep Learning] (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html). <br/>

The code works better on a **GPU** with **cuDNN** (optional).

## Dependencies
This code is written in python. To use it you will need:

- Python 2.7
- Theano 0.7
- A recent version of NumPy
